NPM was causing problems when trying to do this because it said that I didn't have access permissions even as an administrator. Uninstalling npm and reinstalling it again solved this issue.

Installing vue.cli:

```

npm install -g @vue/cli


```

Creating a project with vue.cli:

```

vue create hello-world


```
vue cli wizard options chosen:

    Please pick a preset: CSS Pre-processors
    Pick a linter: ESLint + Airbnb
    Pick a unit testing solution: mocha and chai
    Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, PostCSS [etc...]: In package.json
    Save this as a preset for future projects? enter
    Pick the package manager for installing dependencies: NPM
    Done
