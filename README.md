# Software-concept-snippets

This is a collection of snippets representing software concepts that I come across day to day in my job as a Software Engineer (started April 1st 2019).

Some of the sources will be copy and pasted snippets with the original sources attached to them. Others will be my own writing. Kind of like a research library. 

When I write my own article about a concept, will include a link next to the concept item below.
